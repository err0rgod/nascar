2. Save Results to a File
Write the scan results to a CSV or text file for later analysis.
3. Add OS Detection (Advanced)
Use TTL values or other techniques to guess the operating system of discovered devices.


7. Error Handling & Logging
Add better error handling and optionally log errors to a file.
8. Scan Specific Range
Allow the user to specify a custom IP range (not just CIDR).
9. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Build a simple GUI using tkinter or PyQt.
10. Scan for Vendor Information
Use the MAC address to look up the device vendor (using an OUI database).

add a port scanner

Input Handling:
Nmap accepts IPs, CIDR, and domains (like your improved script).

Host Discovery:
Nmap uses multiple techniques: ARP, ICMP, TCP SYN, TCP ACK, UDP, etc.
Your script uses ARP for LAN and ICMP for WAN.

Port Scanning:
Nmap supports many scan types (SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS, UDP, etc.), service detection, and banner grabbing.
Your script does a basic TCP connect scan.

OS Detection:
Nmap uses advanced fingerprinting (TCP/IP stack quirks, multiple probes, etc.) for accurate OS detection.
Your script uses only TTL (which is a very rough guess).

Service & Version Detection:
Nmap can detect running services and their versions.
Your script does not (unless you add banner grabbing).

Scriptable Engine:
Nmap has NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) for advanced checks.
Your script is not scriptable in this way.

Protocol-Specific Checks
HTTP/HTTPS: Check for open directories (/admin, /phpmyadmin)

SSH: Test for weak credentials (Caution: Ethical/Legal issues!)

FTP: Check for anonymous login





















ðŸ“… 5-Day Development Plan
Goal: Build a modular, extensible scanner in Python (can switch to Go/Rust later if needed).

Day 1: Basic Network Discovery
âœ… Features:

Ping Sweep (ICMP) â€“ Find live hosts.

ARP Scan (Local LAN detection).

Subnet Calculator (Auto-detect or manual input).
ðŸ”¹ Stretch Goal: Multithreading for faster scans.

Day 2: Port Scanning & Service Detection
âœ… Features:

TCP SYN Scan (Stealthy, fast).

TCP Connect Scan (Reliable but noisy).

UDP Scan (Basic).

Banner Grabbing (HTTP, FTP, SSH).
ðŸ”¹ Stretch Goal: Service version detection.

Day 3: OS Detection & Advanced Fingerprinting
âœ… Features:

TCP/IP Stack Fingerprinting (Like Nmap -O).

TTL & Window Size Analysis.

SMB/HTTP OS Leak Checks.
ðŸ”¹ Stretch Goal: Machine Learning-based OS guess.

Day 4: Output & User Experience
âœ… Features:

JSON/CSV/TXT Export.

Colorful CLI Output (Like termcolor).

Scan Profiles (Quick, Stealth, Aggressive).
ðŸ”¹ Stretch Goal: HTML report generation.

Day 5: Optimization & Extra Features
âœ… Features:

Multithreading/Multiprocessing.

IP Geolocation (API-based, like ipinfo.io).

Vulnerability Check (Basic CVE lookup).
ðŸ”¹ Stretch Goal: DNS Enumeration.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack Suggestions
Language: Python (fast prototyping) â†’ Later Go/Rust for speed.

Libraries:

scapy (custom packets, ARP, SYN scans).

socket (basic TCP/UDP checks).

python-nmap (Nmap integration).

requests (banner grabbing).

concurrent.futures (multithreading).

ðŸ”¥ Bonus Ideas (If Time Permits)
Wi-Fi Scanner (Monitor mode, nearby APs).

Packet Sniffer (Live traffic analysis).

GUI (Tkinter/Web-based).

API Mode (Run scans via HTTP requests).
