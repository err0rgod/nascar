2. Save Results to a File
Write the scan results to a CSV or text file for later analysis.
3. Add OS Detection (Advanced)
Use TTL values or other techniques to guess the operating system of discovered devices.


7. Error Handling & Logging
Add better error handling and optionally log errors to a file.
8. Scan Specific Range
Allow the user to specify a custom IP range (not just CIDR).
9. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Build a simple GUI using tkinter or PyQt.
10. Scan for Vendor Information
Use the MAC address to look up the device vendor (using an OUI database).

add a port scanner

Input Handling:
Nmap accepts IPs, CIDR, and domains (like your improved script).

Host Discovery:
Nmap uses multiple techniques: ARP, ICMP, TCP SYN, TCP ACK, UDP, etc.
Your script uses ARP for LAN and ICMP for WAN.

Port Scanning:
Nmap supports many scan types (SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS, UDP, etc.), service detection, and banner grabbing.
Your script does a basic TCP connect scan.

OS Detection:
Nmap uses advanced fingerprinting (TCP/IP stack quirks, multiple probes, etc.) for accurate OS detection.
Your script uses only TTL (which is a very rough guess).

Service & Version Detection:
Nmap can detect running services and their versions.
Your script does not (unless you add banner grabbing).

Scriptable Engine:
Nmap has NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) for advanced checks.
Your script is not scriptable in this way.
